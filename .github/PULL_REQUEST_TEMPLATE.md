## Acceptance Checkboxes (Phases 1–6)
[ ] Phase 1 — Scaffolding & Governance: doctor runs < 30s; run registry + seed policy in place
[ ] Phase 2 — Data Spine: staged/ dir created; contracts module stub with schema and join-key assertions; ingest target no-ops cleanly without data
[ ] Phase 3 — Feature Store v1: Polars lazy pipeline stubs + leakage guard + PSI hook; features target no-ops cleanly
[ ] Phase 4 — Baseline Model: training stub with forward-chaining CV placeholder; calibration plot scaffold; no odds usage
[ ] Phase 5 — Bayesian Team Strength: module stub with recency decay config; returns dummy θ table with CI fields
[ ] Phase 6 — Simulation Engine v1: run.py sim stub with QMC/CI interfaces and early-stop hooks; emits fair ladder placeholders
